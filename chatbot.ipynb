        "An FAQ chatbot can respond to user queries based on a predefined set of frequently asked questions  using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It understands different phrasings of the same question by using machine learning models like sentence embeddings (BERT) instead of simple keyword matching. This allows it to provide accurate, instant, and consistent responses while also supporting multi-turn conversations and entity recognition (NER). Advanced chatbots can also log interactions for analysis, improving efficiency and reducing human workload."

It loads the FAQ dataset, encodes all FAQ questions into the embeddings,and enters to a loop to interact with the user . For each user query, it computes semantic similarity between query and stored FAQ embeddings using cosine similarity. If the best match exceeds a confidence threshold, it returns the corresponding FAQ answer; otherwise, it asks the user to rephrase. Additionally, it extracts named entities from the query and logs the conversation in a JSON file for future analysis.The chatbot continues to run until the user tyoe \"Exit\"."
